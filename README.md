# FINAL PROJECT

This program uses data from two tables accessible through the presentation. The program takes 
the data from the txt file, and processes, organizes, and filters it to create a graph displaying
the trend between air pollution deaths per 100k people, and percentage of population with access 
to at least fundamental filterd water for each respective country. A scatterplot is used to
portray the information, with a reggression curve to solidify the trend.
